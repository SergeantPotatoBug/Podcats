today i discovered that you can make shell scripts
from text files that have the commands in them
and this sub-project is for downloading the artworks
of Darknet Diaries with their corresponding names

what it will do is write the following commands in to a .sh file
    wget [the link]
    rm [the current filename, extracted from the link] [new name, from the RSS feed]

the python file will be writing loads of lines into a textfile in the above
format.
